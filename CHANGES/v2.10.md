## Version 2.10 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.10

- **PLUMED 2.10 requires a C++17 compatible compiler**.

- Changes relevant for developers:
  - Removed some shortcuts for `ActionRegister.h` (from the modules bias colvar function sasa and vatom) and `CLToolRegister.h` (from the module cltools), now the two headers can only be included with `#include "core/ActionRegister.h"` or `#include "core/CLToolRegister.h"`.
  - `plumed mklib` can now process more than one cpp file. Files are combined in a single library.
  - When loading PLUMED at runtime using PLUMED_KERNEL, plumed is loaded with `RTLD_LOCAL` by default. This facilitates running multiple PLUMED versions, e.g. for \ref benchmark.
  - `plumed-runtime` executable can now find a working libplumedKernel.so by looking in the `dlopen` path (including `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and stored RPATH). This should make
    this executable as functional as the normal `plumed` executable but with the advantage of loading symbols in a local namespace (see above). This is not yet working
    on MacOS
